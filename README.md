Work process: 

### step 1: Git repository set 

### Step 2: Downloaded both CSVs from the provided URLs

### Step 3: Used Pandas 
to create dataframe and aggreagate and sum of death and cases ( one table - 2 columns)

### Step 4: stock market research
1. american company:  FB Meta Platforms Inc

2. canadina company: SHOP.TRT - shopify

3. precious metals - GFI  - Gold Fields Ltd

4. real estate : CIGI - Colliers International Group Stock

5. travel sector : BKNG -  Booking Holdings Inc

### step 5: 
used this AlphaVantage api to verify companies and symbol
and make sure AlphaVantage works with this company
https://www.buyupside.com/alphavantagelive/searchforsymboluser.php

### step 6:
for each company we took the output from step 3 and appened the highs and lows to match dates
* since not all the data is there, we used DataFrame option to merge only the matching values and avoid empty cells, 
we don't know the stock market to substite data in any form.

### Step 7:
for each company we plotted the high/low graph and above it the death/confirmed cases, so that the trends will match.
we used matplotlib functions to do so (subplot to place them for visual comparison) 
we used the trend graph and made each line diffrent color and line style, also added a legend to make graph clear.
